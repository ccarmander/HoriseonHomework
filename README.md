# HoriseonHomework

The project given to us was to clean up the code. I had to change the specfied divs into Semantic Elements. When changing the 
the Semantic Elements that would then mess with the CSS sheet, so I would then have to change those around to make sure that 
they worked with the HTML page. Then I cleaned up the CSS sheet as they're multiple classes that we're doing the exact same thing for most sections so I would essentially clean those up turning 3 different classes into 1 and using just the 1. Then I added comments before each element to briefly desribe what part of the webpage code was below.
